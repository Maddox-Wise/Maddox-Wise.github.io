# Virtual Penetration Testing Lab

**Timeframe:** 2025  
**Tools:** VMware, Kali Linux, Nmap  
**Environment:** Fully isolated virtual lab for ethical security testing

---

## Objective

Design and operate a **safe, isolated penetration testing lab** to practice core offensive security techniques without risking production systems or violating legal boundaries. The primary focus was to understand how attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities while reinforcing ethical and responsible testing practices.

---

## Lab Setup

- Created a virtualized lab environment using **VMware**
- Deployed a **Kali Linux** virtual machine as the attacker system
  - Included common offensive security tools (Nmap, Metasploit, etc.)
- Configured multiple **intentionally vulnerable target machines**
  - Examples include outdated services and weak configurations
- Implemented an **isolated virtual network**
  - No internet exposure
  - No access to host or external networks
- Snapshots used to:
  - Reset machines after exploitation
  - Safely repeat testing scenarios

---

## Activities Performed

### Reconnaissance & Scanning
- Conducted network discovery using **Nmap** to:
  - Identify live hosts
  - Enumerate open ports
  - Detect running services and versions
- Analyzed scan results to prioritize attack paths

### Enumeration
- Performed service enumeration to:
  - Identify misconfigured services
  - Detect outdated or vulnerable software
  - Gather information useful for exploitation
- Focused on understanding how small misconfigurations expand attack surface

### Controlled Exploitation
- Tested exploits in a **controlled and non-destructive manner**
- Verified vulnerabilities without causing permanent damage
- Used exploitation results to understand:
  - Impact severity
  - Privilege escalation risks
  - Post-exploitation implications

---

## Documentation & Analysis

- Recorded findings for each target system, including:
  - Discovered vulnerabilities
  - Open services and weak configurations
  - Exploitation steps taken
- Mapped findings to:
  - Common vulnerability categories
  - Real-world attack scenarios
- Proposed **remediation steps**, such as:
  - Patching and updating services
  - Network segmentation
  - Stronger authentication and access controls

---

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- Ensured all testing occurred in a **closed, authorized environment**
- Followed ethical hacking principles at all times
- Reinforced the importance of:
  - Explicit permission
  - Scope definition
  - Responsible disclosure practices

---

## Outcomes & Skills Gained

- Developed hands-on experience with:
  - Network reconnaissance and scanning
  - Service enumeration techniques
  - Basic exploitation workflows
- Improved understanding of:
  - How attackers approach targets
  - Common system and network vulnerabilities
- Strengthened awareness of ethical and legal boundaries in penetration testing
- Built foundational skills applicable to cybersecurity, SOC, and penetration testing roles
